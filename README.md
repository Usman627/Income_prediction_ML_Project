# Income_prediction_ML_Project
Introduction:
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model for predicting people's income using the Random Forest Classifier. Income prediction has numerous real-world applications, such as targeted marketing, loan approvals, and resource allocation. The Random Forest Classifier is a versatile algorithm suitable for classification tasks like this one.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals, including features like age, education level, marital status, occupation, and more. The target variable is the income level, which is categorized as either ">50K" or "<=50K" annually.

Machine Learning Model:
The Random Forest Classifier is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. In this project, we utilized the Random Forest Classifier to build our income prediction model.

Feature Engineering"
Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a machine learning model. We created relevant features based on the available dataset to enhance the model's predictive power. Some of the feature engineering techniques employed in this project include:
•	One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into binary (0/1) format.
•	Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features for uniformity.
•	Handling Missing Values: Dealing with missing data points appropriately.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
To improve the model's performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning. This process involves finding the best combination of hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier through techniques like Grid Search.

Result:
The score of this model is from 80-85%
